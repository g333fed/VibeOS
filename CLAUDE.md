# VibeOS - Claude Context

**IMPORTANT DISK RULES:**
- Never look at the disk
- The disk always works
- `make run` is the only way to compile and run the code - the user will run it
- Trust `make run` - the user will tell you if it is broken
- Do NOT use hdiutil for anything

## Project Overview
VibeOS is a hobby operating system built from scratch for aarch64 (ARM64), targeting QEMU's virt machine. This is a science experiment to see what an LLM can build.

## The Vibe
- **Aesthetic**: Modern macOS-inspired (draggable windows, dock, menu bar)
- **Philosophy**: Simple, educational, nostalgic
- **NOT trying to be**: Linux, production-ready, or modern

## Architecture Decisions (Locked In)
| Component | Decision | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Kernel | Monolithic | Everything in kernel space, Win3.1-style |
| Programs | PIE on disk | Loaded dynamically at runtime, kernel picks address |
| Memory | Flat (no MMU) | No virtual memory, shared address space |
| Multitasking | Cooperative | Programs call yield(), round-robin scheduler |
| Filesystem | FAT32 on virtio-blk | Persistent, mountable on host, read/write |
| Shell | POSIX-ish | Familiar syntax, basic redirects |
| RAM | Detected via DTB | Works with 256MB-4GB+, heap sized dynamically |
| Disk | 64MB FAT32 | Persistent storage via virtio-blk |
| Interrupts | GIC-400 | Keyboard & mouse via IRQ, boots at EL3 for full GIC access |
| Power | WFI idle | Scheduler sleeps CPU when no work, wakes on interrupt |

## Gotchas / Lessons Learned
- **aarch64 va_list**: Can't pass va_list to helper functions easily. Inline the va_arg handling.
- **QEMU virt machine**: Uses PL011 UART at 0x09000000, GIC at 0x08000000
- **Virtio legacy vs modern**: QEMU defaults to legacy virtio (version 1). Use `-global virtio-mmio.force-legacy=false` to get modern virtio (version 2).
- **Virtio memory barriers**: ARM needs `dsb sy` barriers around device register access.
- **strncpy hangs**: Our strncpy implementation causes hangs in some cases. Use manual loops instead.
- **Static array memset**: Don't memset large static arrays - they're already zero-initialized.
- **GIC Security Groups**: GIC interrupts require matching security configuration. If running in Secure EL1, use Group 0 interrupts. Group 1 interrupts in Secure state return IRQ 1022 (spurious). Boot with `-bios` and `secure=on` to start at EL3 with full GIC register access.
- **-mgeneral-regs-only**: Use this flag to prevent GCC from using SIMD registers.
- **Stack in BSS**: Boot hangs if stack is in .bss section - it gets zeroed while in use! Put stack in separate .stack section.
- **Embedded binaries**: objcopy binary embedding breaks with 6+ programs. Linker issue. Just use monolith kernel instead.
- **Console without framebuffer**: console_puts/putc fall back to UART if fb_base is NULL.
- **kapi colors**: Must use uint32_t for colors (RGB values like 0x00FF00), not uint8_t.
- **Packed structs on ARM**: Accessing fields in `__attribute__((packed))` structs causes unaligned access faults. Read bytes individually and assemble values manually.
- **FAT32 minimum size**: FAT32 requires at least ~33MB. Use 64MB disk image.
- **Virtio-blk polling**: Save `used->idx` before submitting request, then poll until it changes. Don't use a global `last_used_idx` that persists across requests.
- **Virtio-input device detection**: Both keyboard and tablet are virtio-input. Must check device name contains "Keyboard" specifically, not just starts with "Q".
- **Userspace has no stdint.h**: Use `unsigned long` instead of `uint64_t` in user programs, or define types in vibe.h.
- **PIE on AArch64**: Use `-fPIE` and `-pie` flags. ELF loader processes R_AARCH64_RELATIVE relocations at load time.
- **Context switch**: Only need to save callee-saved registers (x19-x30, sp). Caller-saved regs are already on stack.
- **PIE relocations (FIXED!)**: Use `-O0` for userspace to ensure GCC generates relocations for static pointer initializers. With `-O2`, GCC tries to be clever and compute addresses at runtime, but puts structs in BSS (zeroed) so pointers are NULL. The ELF loader now processes `.rela.dyn` section and fixes up `R_AARCH64_RELATIVE` entries. Normal C code with pointers now works!
- **strtok_r NULL rest**: After the last token, `strtok_r` sets `rest` to NULL (not empty string). Always check `rest && *rest` before dereferencing.
- **Flash/RAM linker split**: When booting via `-bios`, code lives in flash (0x0) but data/BSS must be in RAM (0x40000000). Use separate MEMORY regions in linker script with `AT>` for load addresses. Copy .data from flash to RAM at boot.
- **EL3→EL1 direct**: Can skip EL2 entirely. Set `SCR_EL3` with NS=0 (stay Secure), RW=1 (AArch64), then eret to EL1.
- **WFI in scheduler**: When a process yields and it's the only runnable process, WFI before returning to it. This prevents busy-wait loops from cooking the CPU. The kernel handles idle, not individual apps.
- **Don't double-sleep**: If kernel WFIs on idle, apps shouldn't also sleep_ms() - that causes double delay and sluggish UI. Apps just yield(), kernel handles the rest.
- **FAT32 LFN + GCC -O2**: The LFN entry building code crashes with -O2 optimization. Use -O0 for fat32.c. Symptom: translation fault when writing to valid heap memory. Root cause unknown but likely optimizer generating bad code for the byte-by-byte LFN entry construction.
- **Stack must be above BSS**: As kernel grows, BSS section grows. Stack pointer must be well above BSS end. Originally at 0x40010000, but BSS grew to 0x400290d4 - stack was inside BSS and got zeroed during boot! Moved to 0x40100000 (1MB into RAM).
- **_data_load must be 8-byte aligned**: AArch64 `ldr x3, [x0]` instruction requires 8-byte alignment. If `_data_load` in linker script is not aligned, boot hangs during .data copy loop. Add `. = ALIGN(8);` before `_data_load = .;`.
- **Build with -O0 for safety**: GCC optimization causes subtle bugs in OS code - PIE relocations, LFN construction, possibly virtio drivers. Using -O0 everywhere avoids these issues at cost of larger/slower code.
- **FPU enable**: Set CPACR_EL1.FPEN = 0b11 in boot.S to enable FP/SIMD. Without this, any FP instruction causes an exception.
- **FP context switch**: When FPU is enabled, context_switch must save/restore q0-q31, fpcr, fpsr. The fp_regs array must be 16-byte aligned (stp/ldp q regs require this). Added padding to cpu_context_t to ensure fp_regs is at offset 0x80.
- **-mstrict-align required with FPU**: Without -mgeneral-regs-only, GCC uses SIMD for memcpy/struct copies. Some SIMD loads require aligned addresses. Use -mstrict-align to prevent unaligned SIMD access faults.
- **Kernel stack vs heap collision**: Heap runs from `_bss_end + 0x10000` to `0x41000000`. If kernel stack is inside this range, large allocations (like framebuffer backbuffer) will overwrite the stack. Symptom: local variables corrupted with data like `0x00ffffff` (COLOR_WHITE). Stack was at 0x40100000 (inside heap!). Moved to 0x4F000000 (well above heap and program area).
- **DTB at RAM start**: QEMU places the Device Tree Blob at 0x40000000 (start of RAM). Linker script must start .data/.bss after DTB area (we use 0x40200000, leaving 2MB for DTB).
- **DTB unaligned access**: Reading 32/64-bit values from DTB can cause alignment faults on ARM. Read bytes individually and assemble manually (see `read_be32`/`read_be64` in dtb.c).
- **TTF italic buffer overflow**: When applying styles to glyphs, track original glyph width vs allocated stride separately. If a function calculates "extra space needed" and you pass an already-expanded buffer, it will double the expansion and overflow. The `apply_italic` bug wrote past buffer end, corrupting heap metadata.
- **DWC2 USB MPS for Full Speed**: When enumerating Full Speed USB devices, use MPS=64, not 8! FS devices can send up to 64 bytes per packet. Using MPS=8 causes babble error when byte 9 arrives. Only Low Speed devices use MPS=8.
- **DWC2 USB PHY clock on Pi**: Pi uses UTMI+ PHY at 60MHz. Set HCFG.FSLSPCLKSEL=0 (30/60MHz mode), NOT 1 (48MHz). Wrong setting causes premature frame end and babble errors.
- **DWC2 USB multi-packet IN transfers**: In slave mode, must re-enable channel after each packet received. Controller doesn't automatically continue. Re-enable on ACK and IN_COMPLETE events.
- **DWC2 USB GRXSTSP parsing**: Only read FIFO data when pktsts=2 (IN data) and bcnt>0. Other status values (3=complete, 7=halted) don't have data to read.
- **DWC2 USB split transactions broken**: FS devices behind HS hubs require split transactions. The DWC2 split transaction state machine (start-split → complete-split) had issues causing infinite NYET loops. Workaround: Set `HCFG_FSLSUPP` to force Full-Speed only mode. Hub connects at FS, no splits needed. 12 Mbps is plenty for keyboard/mouse.
- **USB msleep must use kernel timer**: The USB driver's msleep() using ARM generic timer (`cntfrq_el0`) didn't work on Pi. Use kernel's `sleep_ms()` which uses timer tick interrupts. Interrupts must be enabled before USB init.
