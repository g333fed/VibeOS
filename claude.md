# VibeOS - Claude Context

**IMPORTANT: THERE IS NEVER A READ-ONLY DISK ERROR. `make clean && make` WILL PREPARE THE DISK CORRECTLY AND IT WILL WORK. DO NOT USE HDIUTIL TO CHECK OR DEBUG DISK ISSUES.**

## Project Overview
VibeOS is a hobby operating system built from scratch for aarch64 (ARM64), targeting QEMU's virt machine. This is a science experiment to see what an LLM can build.

## The Vibe
- **Aesthetic**: Retro Mac System 7 / Apple Lisa (1-bit black & white, Chicago-style fonts, classic Mac UI)
- **Philosophy**: Simple, educational, nostalgic
- **NOT trying to be**: Linux, production-ready, or modern

## Team
- **Human**: Vibes only. Yells "fuck yeah" when things work. Cannot provide technical guidance.
- **Claude**: Full technical lead. Makes all architecture decisions. Wozniak energy.

## Current State (Last Updated: Session 17)
- [x] Bootloader (boot/boot.S) - Sets up stack, clears BSS, jumps to kernel
- [x] Minimal kernel (kernel/kernel.c) - UART output working

- user/bin/*.c - Program sources
- user/linker.ld - Program linker script (PIE, base at 0x0)

### Build & Run
```bash
make            # Build kernel AND all user programs (everything)
make clean      # Clean build artifacts
make disk       # Create FAT32 disk image (only needed once)
make run        # Run with GUI window (serial still in terminal)
make run-nographic  # Terminal only
make distclean  # Clean everything including disk image
```

**IMPORTANT**: `make` builds EVERYTHING - kernel and all user programs. There is no separate user-progs target. Just use `make clean && make` to rebuild.

### Mounting the Disk Image (macOS)
```bash
hdiutil attach disk.img        # Mount
# ... add/edit files in /Volumes/VIBEOS/ ...
hdiutil detach /Volumes/VIBEOS # Unmount before running QEMU
```

## Architecture Decisions (Locked In)
| Component | Decision | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Kernel | Monolithic | Everything in kernel space, Win3.1-style |
| Programs | PIE on disk | Loaded dynamically at runtime, kernel picks address |
| Memory | Flat (no MMU) | No virtual memory, shared address space |
| Multitasking | Cooperative | Programs call yield(), round-robin scheduler |
| Filesystem | FAT32 on virtio-blk | Persistent, mountable on host, read/write |
| Shell | POSIX-ish | Familiar syntax, basic redirects |
| RAM | 256MB | Configurable |
| Disk | 64MB FAT32 | Persistent storage via virtio-blk |
| Interrupts | GIC-400 | Keyboard via IRQ, boots at EL3 for full GIC access |

## Gotchas / Lessons Learned
- **aarch64 va_list**: Can't pass va_list to helper functions easily. Inline the va_arg handling.
- **QEMU virt machine**: Uses PL011 UART at 0x09000000, GIC at 0x08000000
- **Virtio legacy vs modern**: QEMU defaults to legacy virtio (version 1). Use `-global virtio-mmio.force-legacy=false` to get modern virtio (version 2).
- **Virtio memory barriers**: ARM needs `dsb sy` barriers around device register access.
- **strncpy hangs**: Our strncpy implementation causes hangs in some cases. Use manual loops instead.
- **Static array memset**: Don't memset large static arrays - they're already zero-initialized.
- **GIC Security Groups**: GIC interrupts require matching security configuration. If running in Secure EL1, use Group 0 interrupts. Group 1 interrupts in Secure state return IRQ 1022 (spurious). Boot with `-bios` and `secure=on` to start at EL3 with full GIC register access.
- **-mgeneral-regs-only**: Use this flag to prevent GCC from using SIMD registers.
- **Stack in BSS**: Boot hangs if stack is in .bss section - it gets zeroed while in use! Put stack in separate .stack section.
- **Embedded binaries**: objcopy binary embedding breaks with 6+ programs. Linker issue. Just use monolith kernel instead.
- **Console without framebuffer**: console_puts/putc fall back to UART if fb_base is NULL.
- **kapi colors**: Must use uint32_t for colors (RGB values like 0x00FF00), not uint8_t.
- **Packed structs on ARM**: Accessing fields in `__attribute__((packed))` structs causes unaligned access faults. Read bytes individually and assemble values manually.
- **FAT32 minimum size**: FAT32 requires at least ~33MB. Use 64MB disk image.
- **Virtio-blk polling**: Save `used->idx` before submitting request, then poll until it changes. Don't use a global `last_used_idx` that persists across requests.
- **Virtio-input device detection**: Both keyboard and tablet are virtio-input. Must check device name contains "Keyboard" specifically, not just starts with "Q".
- **Userspace has no stdint.h**: Use `unsigned long` instead of `uint64_t` in user programs, or define types in vibe.h.
- **PIE on AArch64**: Use `-fPIE` and `-pie` flags. ELF loader processes R_AARCH64_RELATIVE relocations at load time.
- **Context switch**: Only need to save callee-saved registers (x19-x30, sp). Caller-saved regs are already on stack.
- **PIE relocations (FIXED!)**: Use `-O0` for userspace to ensure GCC generates relocations for static pointer initializers. With `-O2`, GCC tries to be clever and compute addresses at runtime, but puts structs in BSS (zeroed) so pointers are NULL. The ELF loader now processes `.rela.dyn` section and fixes up `R_AARCH64_RELATIVE` entries. Normal C code with pointers now works!
- **strtok_r NULL rest**: After the last token, `strtok_r` sets `rest` to NULL (not empty string). Always check `rest && *rest` before dereferencing.
- **Flash/RAM linker split**: When booting via `-bios`, code lives in flash (0x0) but data/BSS must be in RAM (0x40000000). Use separate MEMORY regions in linker script with `AT>` for load addresses. Copy .data from flash to RAM at boot.
- **EL3→EL1 direct**: Can skip EL2 entirely. Set `SCR_EL3` with NS=0 (stay Secure), RW=1 (AArch64), then eret to EL1.

## Session Log
### Session 1

- Successfully booted in QEMU, UART output works
- Decided on retro Mac aesthetic
- Human confirmed: terminal-first approach, take it slow
- Added memory management (heap allocator) - working
- Added string functions and printf - working after fixing va_list issue

### Session 2
- Fixed virtio keyboard (was using legacy mode, switched to modern with force-legacy=false)
- Built framebuffer driver using ramfb
- Added bitmap font and text console with colors
- Built in-kernel shell with commands

- Added shift key support for keyboard (uppercase, symbols like >)
- Everything working! Shell, filesystem, keyboard all functional

### Session 3

- Games now use exec() instead of spawn():
  - Desktop blocks while game runs, resumes when game exits
  - Clean handoff - no screen fighting between processes
- **Achievement**: Can launch games from dock and return to desktop!

### Session 14
- Built userspace shell `/bin/vibesh`:
  - Boots directly into vibesh (kernel shell is now just a bootstrap)
  - Parses commands, handles builtins (cd, exit, help)
  - Executes external programs from /bin with argument passing
- Built userspace coreutils:
  - `/bin/echo` - with output redirection support (echo foo > file)
  - `/bin/ls` - uses proper readdir API
  - `/bin/cat` - supports multiple files
  - `/bin/pwd` - print working directory
  - `/bin/mkdir`, `/bin/touch`, `/bin/rm` - file operations
- Added `exec_args` to kapi for passing argc/argv to programs
- Added `console_rows`/`console_cols` to kapi
- Fixed process exit bug:
  - process_exit() was returning when no other processes existed
  - Now context switches directly back to kernel_context
- Attempted userspace vi but hit PIE/BSS issues:
  - Static variables in PIE binaries don't work reliably
  - Even heap-allocated state with function pointer calls hangs
  - Abandoned - will make GUI editor instead
- **Achievement**: Userspace shell and coreutils working!

### Session 15
- **MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH: Fixed PIE relocations!**
  - Userspace C code now works like normal C - pointers, string literals, everything
  - Problem: Static initializers with pointers (e.g., `const char *label = "hello"`) were broken
  - Root cause: With `-O2`, GCC generates PC-relative code but puts struct in BSS (zeroed), so pointers are NULL
  - Solution 1: Use `-O0` for userspace so GCC generates proper relocations
  - Solution 2: ELF loader now processes `.rela.dyn` section with `R_AARCH64_RELATIVE` entries
  - Added `Elf64_Dyn`, `Elf64_Rela` structs and `elf_process_relocations()` to kernel/elf.c
  - Formula: `*(load_base + offset) = load_base + addend`
- Rebuilt desktop from scratch (old one was a mess with everything embedded):
  - Clean window manager architecture
  - Desktop just manages windows, dock, menu bar, cursor
  - Apps are separate binaries that use window API via kapi
  - Fullscreen apps (snake, tetris) use exec() - desktop waits
  - Windowed apps (calc) use spawn() + window API
- Built Calculator app (`/bin/calc`):
  - First proper windowed app using the new window API
  - Creates window, gets buffer, draws buttons, receives events
  - Working integer arithmetic
- Window API in kapi:
  - `window_create()`, `window_destroy()`, `window_get_buffer()`
  - `window_poll_event()`, `window_invalidate()`, `window_set_title()`
  - Desktop registers these functions at startup
- **Achievement**: Can now write normal C code in userspace! This unlocks everything.

### Session 16
- **Visual refresh - True Mac System 7 aesthetic!**
  - Pure 1-bit black & white color scheme
  - Classic Mac diagonal checkerboard desktop pattern
  - Apple logo (16x16 bitmap) in menu bar
  - Beautiful 32x32 pixel art dock icons: Snake, Tetris, Calculator, Files, Terminal
  - System 7 window chrome: horizontal stripes on focused title bars, drop shadows, double-line borders
  - Close box with inner square when focused
  - Clock in menu bar (decorative)
- **Built Terminal Emulator (`/bin/term`)!**
  - 80x24 character window with monospace font
  - Spawns vibesh shell inside the window
  - Stdio hooks mechanism: `stdio_putc`, `stdio_puts`, `stdio_getc`, `stdio_has_key`
  - Shell and all coreutils use hooks when available, fall back to console otherwise
  - Keyboard input via window events → ring buffer → shell reads
  - Inverse block cursor
- **Updated all coreutils for terminal support:**
  - ls, cat, echo, pwd, mkdir, touch, rm all use `out_puts`/`out_putc` helpers
  - Check for stdio hooks, use them if set, otherwise use console I/O
  - Works in both kernel console AND terminal window
- **Achievement**: Shell running inside a GUI window! Can run commands, see output, everything works!

### Session 17
- **INTERRUPTS FINALLY WORKING!**
  - Root cause found: GIC security groups. Running in Non-Secure EL1 but trying to configure Group 0 registers was a no-op.
  - Solution: Boot at EL3 (Secure) using `-bios` instead of `-kernel`, stay in Secure world
  - Changed QEMU flags: `-M virt,secure=on -bios vibeos.bin`
  - Updated linker script: code at 0x0 (flash), data/BSS in RAM (0x40000000)
  - Updated boot.S: EL3→EL1 transition (skip EL2), copy .data from flash to RAM
  - GIC configured for Group 0 (Secure) interrupts
- **New files:**
  - `kernel/irq.c` / `kernel/irq.h` - GIC-400 driver, timer support
  - `kernel/vectors.S` - Exception vector table for AArch64
- **Keyboard now interrupt-driven:**
  - Registered IRQ handler for virtio keyboard (IRQ 78)
  - No more polling needed for keyboard input
- **Fixed FAT32 bug:**
  - `resolve_path()` was dereferencing NULL `rest` pointer from `strtok_r`
  - Added NULL check: `if (rest && *rest && ...)`
- **Timer ready but disabled:**
  - Timer IRQ handler exists, can enable preemptive multitasking later
  - Currently disabled to keep cooperative model stable
- **Achievement**: Full interrupt support! GIC mystery finally solved after Sessions 2-3 failures!

**NEXT SESSION TODO:**
- Enable timer for preemptive multitasking
- Build notepad/GUI text editor
- Build file explorer as windowed app
- Maybe DOOM?
