# VibeOS - Claude Context

## Project Overview
VibeOS is a hobby operating system built from scratch for aarch64 (ARM64), targeting QEMU's virt machine. This is a science experiment to see what an LLM can build.

## The Vibe
- **Aesthetic**: Retro Mac System 7 / Apple Lisa (1-bit black & white, Chicago-style fonts, classic Mac UI)
- **Philosophy**: Simple, educational, nostalgic
- **NOT trying to be**: Linux, production-ready, or modern

## Team
- **Human**: Vibes only. Yells "fuck yeah" when things work. Cannot provide technical guidance.
- **Claude**: Full technical lead. Makes all architecture decisions. Wozniak energy.

## Current State (Last Updated: Session 9)
- [x] Bootloader (boot/boot.S) - Sets up stack, clears BSS, jumps to kernel
- [x] Minimal kernel (kernel/kernel.c) - UART output working
- [x] Linker script (linker.ld) - Memory layout for QEMU virt
- [x] Makefile - Builds and runs in QEMU
- [x] Boots successfully! Prints to serial console.
- [x] Memory management (kernel/memory.c) - malloc/free working, 255MB heap
- [x] String functions (kernel/string.c) - memcpy, strlen, strcmp, strtok_r, etc.
- [x] Printf (kernel/printf.c) - %d, %s, %x, %p working
- [x] Framebuffer (kernel/fb.c) - ramfb device, 800x600
- [x] Bitmap font (kernel/font.c) - 8x16 VGA-style font
- [x] Console (kernel/console.c) - Text console with colors on screen
- [x] Virtio keyboard (kernel/keyboard.c) - Full keyboard with shift support
- [x] Shell (kernel/shell.c) - In-kernel shell with commands
- [x] VFS (kernel/vfs.c) - Now backed by FAT32, falls back to in-memory
- [x] Coreutils - ls, cd, pwd, mkdir, touch, cat, echo (with > redirect)
- [x] ELF loader (kernel/elf.c) - Loads PIE binaries at dynamic addresses
- [x] Process management (kernel/process.c) - Process table, context switching, scheduler
- [x] Cooperative multitasking - yield(), spawn() in kapi, round-robin scheduler
- [x] Kernel API (kernel/kapi.c) - Function pointers for programs to call kernel
- [x] Text editor (kernel/vi.c) - Modal vi clone with normal/insert/command modes
- [x] Virtio block device (kernel/virtio_blk.c) - Read/write disk sectors
- [x] FAT32 filesystem (kernel/fat32.c) - Read/write, supports long filenames
- [x] Persistent storage - 64MB FAT32 disk image, mountable on macOS
- [ ] Interrupts - GIC/timer code exists but disabled (breaks virtio - unknown bug)

## Architecture Decisions Made
1. **Target**: QEMU virt machine, aarch64, Cortex-A72
2. **Memory start**: 0x40000000 (QEMU virt default)
3. **UART**: PL011 at 0x09000000 (QEMU virt default)
4. **Stack**: 64KB, placed in .stack section after BSS
5. **Toolchain**: aarch64-elf-gcc (brew install)
6. **Compiler flags**: -mgeneral-regs-only (no SIMD)
7. **Process model**: Win3.1 style - no memory protection, programs run in kernel space

## Roadmap (Terminal-First)
Phase 1: Kernel Foundations - DONE
1. ~~Memory management~~ - heap allocator working
2. ~~libc basics~~ - string functions, sprintf
3. ~~Display~~ - framebuffer, console, font
4. ~~Keyboard~~ - virtio-input with shift keys
5. ~~Shell~~ - in-kernel with basic commands

9. **DECISION**: Monolith kernel - all commands built into shell
   - Tried external programs, hit linker issues with 6+ embedded binaries
   - Win3.1 vibes - everything in one binary is fine

Phase 3: Apps (DONE)
10. ~~Text editor~~ - vi clone with modal editing (normal/insert/command modes)
11. ~~Snake~~ - moved to /bin/snake userspace program
12. ~~Tetris~~ - moved to /bin/tetris userspace program

## Architecture Decisions (Locked In)
| Component | Decision | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Kernel | Monolithic | Everything in kernel space, Win3.1-style |
| Programs | PIE on disk | Loaded dynamically at runtime, kernel picks address |
| Memory | Flat (no MMU) | No virtual memory, shared address space |
| Multitasking | Cooperative | Programs call yield(), round-robin scheduler |
| Filesystem | FAT32 on virtio-blk | Persistent, mountable on host, read/write |
| Shell | POSIX-ish | Familiar syntax, basic redirects |
| RAM | 256MB | Configurable |
| Disk | 64MB FAT32 | Persistent storage via virtio-blk |
| Interrupts | Disabled | Polling works, interrupts break virtio (bug) |

## Gotchas / Lessons Learned
- **aarch64 va_list**: Can't pass va_list to helper functions easily. Inline the va_arg handling.
- **QEMU virt machine**: Uses PL011 UART at 0x09000000, GIC at 0x08000000
- **Virtio legacy vs modern**: QEMU defaults to legacy virtio (version 1). Use `-global virtio-mmio.force-legacy=false` to get modern virtio (version 2).
- **Virtio memory barriers**: ARM needs `dsb sy` barriers around device register access.
- **strncpy hangs**: Our strncpy implementation causes hangs in some cases. Use manual loops instead.
- **Static array memset**: Don't memset large static arrays - they're already zero-initialized.
- **Interrupts + Virtio**: Enabling GIC interrupts breaks virtio keyboard polling. Unknown root cause. Skipped for now - cooperative multitasking doesn't need interrupts anyway.
- **-mgeneral-regs-only**: Use this flag to prevent GCC from using SIMD registers.
- **Stack in BSS**: Boot hangs if stack is in .bss section - it gets zeroed while in use! Put stack in separate .stack section.
- **Embedded binaries**: objcopy binary embedding breaks with 6+ programs. Linker issue. Just use monolith kernel instead.
- **Console without framebuffer**: console_puts/putc fall back to UART if fb_base is NULL.
- **kapi colors**: Must use uint32_t for colors (RGB values like 0x00FF00), not uint8_t.
- **Packed structs on ARM**: Accessing fields in `__attribute__((packed))` structs causes unaligned access faults. Read bytes individually and assemble values manually.
- **FAT32 minimum size**: FAT32 requires at least ~33MB. Use 64MB disk image.
- **Virtio-blk polling**: Save `used->idx` before submitting request, then poll until it changes. Don't use a global `last_used_idx` that persists across requests.
- **Virtio-input device detection**: Both keyboard and tablet are virtio-input. Must check device name contains "Keyboard" specifically, not just starts with "Q".
- **Userspace has no stdint.h**: Use `unsigned long` instead of `uint64_t` in user programs, or define types in vibe.h.
- **PIE on AArch64**: Use `-fPIE` and `-pie` flags. AArch64 uses PC-relative addressing (ADRP+ADD) so no runtime relocations needed.
- **Context switch**: Only need to save callee-saved registers (x19-x30, sp). Caller-saved regs are already on stack.

## Session Log
### Session 1
- Created project structure
- Wrote bootloader, minimal kernel, linker script, Makefile
- Successfully booted in QEMU, UART output works
- Decided on retro Mac aesthetic
- Human confirmed: terminal-first approach, take it slow
- Added memory management (heap allocator) - working
- Added string functions and printf - working after fixing va_list issue

### Session 2
- Fixed virtio keyboard (was using legacy mode, switched to modern with force-legacy=false)
- Built framebuffer driver using ramfb
- Added bitmap font and text console with colors
- Built in-kernel shell with commands
- Attempted interrupts (GIC, timer, exception vectors) - breaks virtio keyboard
- Debugged extensively, even asked Gemini - couldn't find root cause
- Decided to skip interrupts (cooperative multitasking doesn't need them)
- Built in-memory VFS filesystem
- Added coreutils: ls, cd, pwd, mkdir, touch, cat
- Added echo with > redirect for writing files
- Added shift key support for keyboard (uppercase, symbols like >)
- Everything working! Shell, filesystem, keyboard all functional

### Session 3
- Attempted proper userspace with syscalls (SVC instruction)
- SVC never triggered exception handler - extensive debugging failed
- Pivoted to Win3.1 style: programs run in kernel space, call kapi directly
- Built ELF loader and process execution
- Created kapi (kernel API) - struct of function pointers
- Fixed multiple bugs: ELF load address (0x40200000), crt0 return address, color types
- Attempted to move shell commands to /bin as separate programs
- Hit weird linker bug: 5 embedded programs work, 6 breaks boot
- Extensive debugging: not size, not specific program, just "6th binary breaks it"
- Stack was in BSS and getting zeroed - fixed by putting in .stack section
- Still couldn't fix the 6-binary limit
- **DECISION**: Monolith kernel. All commands stay in shell. Fuck it, it's VibeOS.
- Final kernel: 28KB, all features working

### Session 6
- Revisited the external binaries problem - decided to use persistent FAT32 filesystem instead
- Built virtio-blk driver for block device access
- Implemented FAT32 filesystem driver (read-only)
- Integrated FAT32 with VFS - now `/` is backed by the disk image
- Updated Makefile to create and format 64MB FAT32 disk image
- Fixed multiple bugs:
  - Virtio-blk polling logic (was using stale `last_used_idx`)
  - Packed struct access on ARM (unaligned access faults) - read bytes manually
  - FAT32 minimum size requirement (increased from 32MB to 64MB)
- Disk image is mountable on macOS with `hdiutil attach disk.img`
- Can now put binaries on disk and load them at runtime (solves the 6-binary limit!)
- **Achievement**: Persistent filesystem working! Files survive reboots!

### Session 7
- Made FAT32 filesystem writable!
- Added FAT table write support (fat_set_cluster) - updates both FAT copies
- Added cluster allocation (fat_alloc_cluster) - finds free clusters
- Added cluster chain freeing (fat_free_chain)
- Implemented fat32_create_file() - create empty files
- Implemented fat32_mkdir() - create directories with . and .. entries
- Implemented fat32_write_file() - write data to files, handles cluster allocation
- Implemented fat32_delete() - delete files and free their clusters
- Updated VFS layer to use FAT32 write functions
- Now mkdir, touch, echo > file all persist to disk!
- Files created in VibeOS are visible when mounting disk.img on macOS
- **Achievement**: Full read/write persistent filesystem!

### Session 8
- Moved snake and tetris from kernel to userspace (/bin/snake, /bin/tetris)
- Extended kapi with framebuffer access (fb_base, width, height, drawing functions)
- Extended kapi with mouse input (position, buttons, poll)
- Added uart_puts to kapi for direct UART debug output
- Built virtio-tablet mouse driver (kernel/mouse.c)
- Fixed keyboard detection to not conflict with tablet (both are virtio-input)
- Created /bin/desktop - window manager with:
  - Classic Mac System 7 aesthetic (gray desktop, striped title bars)
  - Draggable windows by title bar
  - Close boxes that work
  - Menu bar (File, Edit, View, Special)
  - Mouse cursor with save/restore
  - Double buffering to reduce flicker
- Fixed heap/program memory overlap bug:
  - Backbuffer allocation (~2MB) was overlapping program load address
  - Moved program load address from 0x40200000 to 0x40400000
- **Achievement**: GUI desktop environment working!

### Session 9
- Implemented dynamic program loading - no more hardcoded addresses!
- Converted userspace programs to PIE (Position Independent Executables)
  - Updated user/linker.ld to base at 0x0
  - Added `-fPIE` and `-pie` compiler/linker flags
- Enhanced ELF loader:
  - elf_load_at() loads PIE binaries at any address
  - elf_calc_size() calculates memory requirements
  - Supports both ET_EXEC and ET_DYN types
- Built cooperative multitasking infrastructure:
  - Process table (MAX_PROCESSES = 16)
  - Process states: FREE, READY, RUNNING, BLOCKED, ZOMBIE
  - Round-robin scheduler
  - Context switching in assembly (kernel/context.S)
  - yield() and spawn() added to kapi
- Programs now load at 0x41000000+ with kernel picking addresses dynamically
- Tested: desktop→snake→tetris→desktop all load at different addresses
- **Achievement**: Dynamic loading and multitasking foundation complete!

### Session 10
- Added Apple menu with dropdown (About VibeOS..., Quit Desktop)
- Removed Q keyboard shortcut - quit only via Apple menu now
- Added font_data pointer to kapi for userspace text rendering
- Fixed window rendering - all drawing now goes to backbuffer:
  - Added bb_draw_char/bb_draw_string for backbuffer text
  - Windows properly occlude each other (no text bleed-through)
  - Title bars, content areas, and borders all render correctly
- Created LONGTERM.md with roadmap

### Session 11
