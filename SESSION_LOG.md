## Session Log
### Session 1
- Created project structure
- Wrote bootloader, minimal kernel, linker script, Makefile
- Successfully booted in QEMU, UART output works
- Decided on retro Mac aesthetic
- Human confirmed: terminal-first approach, take it slow
- Added memory management (heap allocator) - working
- Added string functions and printf - working after fixing va_list issue

### Session 2
- Fixed virtio keyboard (was using legacy mode, switched to modern with force-legacy=false)
- Built framebuffer driver using ramfb
- Added bitmap font and text console with colors
- Built in-kernel shell with commands
- Attempted interrupts (GIC, timer, exception vectors) - breaks virtio keyboard
- Debugged extensively, even asked Gemini - couldn't find root cause
- Decided to skip interrupts (cooperative multitasking doesn't need them)
- Built in-memory VFS filesystem
- Added coreutils: ls, cd, pwd, mkdir, touch, cat
- Added echo with > redirect for writing files
- Added shift key support for keyboard (uppercase, symbols like >)
- Everything working! Shell, filesystem, keyboard all functional

### Session 3
- Attempted proper userspace with syscalls (SVC instruction)
- SVC never triggered exception handler - extensive debugging failed
- Pivoted to Win3.1 style: programs run in kernel space, call kapi directly
- Built ELF loader and process execution
- Created kapi (kernel API) - struct of function pointers
- Fixed multiple bugs: ELF load address (0x40200000), crt0 return address, color types
- Attempted to move shell commands to /bin as separate programs
- Hit weird linker bug: 5 embedded programs work, 6 breaks boot
- Extensive debugging: not size, not specific program, just "6th binary breaks it"
- Stack was in BSS and getting zeroed - fixed by putting in .stack section
- Still couldn't fix the 6-binary limit
- **DECISION**: Monolith kernel. All commands stay in shell. Fuck it, it's VibeOS.
- Final kernel: 28KB, all features working

### Session 6
- Revisited the external binaries problem - decided to use persistent FAT32 filesystem instead
- Built virtio-blk driver for block device access
- Implemented FAT32 filesystem driver (read-only)
- Integrated FAT32 with VFS - now `/` is backed by the disk image
- Updated Makefile to create and format 64MB FAT32 disk image
- Fixed multiple bugs:
  - Virtio-blk polling logic (was using stale `last_used_idx`)
  - Packed struct access on ARM (unaligned access faults) - read bytes manually
  - FAT32 minimum size requirement (increased from 32MB to 64MB)
- Disk image is mountable on macOS with `hdiutil attach disk.img`
- Can now put binaries on disk and load them at runtime (solves the 6-binary limit!)
- **Achievement**: Persistent filesystem working! Files survive reboots!

### Session 7
- Made FAT32 filesystem writable!
- Added FAT table write support (fat_set_cluster) - updates both FAT copies
- Added cluster allocation (fat_alloc_cluster) - finds free clusters
- Added cluster chain freeing (fat_free_chain)
- Implemented fat32_create_file() - create empty files
- Implemented fat32_mkdir() - create directories with . and .. entries
- Implemented fat32_write_file() - write data to files, handles cluster allocation
- Implemented fat32_delete() - delete files and free their clusters
- Updated VFS layer to use FAT32 write functions
- Now mkdir, touch, echo > file all persist to disk!
- Files created in VibeOS are visible when mounting disk.img on macOS
- **Achievement**: Full read/write persistent filesystem!

### Session 8
- Moved snake and tetris from kernel to userspace (/bin/snake, /bin/tetris)
- Extended kapi with framebuffer access (fb_base, width, height, drawing functions)
- Extended kapi with mouse input (position, buttons, poll)
- Added uart_puts to kapi for direct UART debug output
- Built virtio-tablet mouse driver (kernel/mouse.c)
- Fixed keyboard detection to not conflict with tablet (both are virtio-input)
- Created /bin/desktop - window manager with:
  - Classic Mac System 7 aesthetic (gray desktop, striped title bars)
  - Draggable windows by title bar
  - Close boxes that work
  - Menu bar (File, Edit, View, Special)
  - Mouse cursor with save/restore
  - Double buffering to reduce flicker
- Fixed heap/program memory overlap bug:
  - Backbuffer allocation (~2MB) was overlapping program load address
  - Moved program load address from 0x40200000 to 0x40400000
- **Achievement**: GUI desktop environment working!

### Session 9
- Implemented dynamic program loading - no more hardcoded addresses!
- Converted userspace programs to PIE (Position Independent Executables)
  - Updated user/linker.ld to base at 0x0
  - Added `-fPIE` and `-pie` compiler/linker flags
- Enhanced ELF loader:
  - elf_load_at() loads PIE binaries at any address
  - elf_calc_size() calculates memory requirements
  - Supports both ET_EXEC and ET_DYN types
- Built cooperative multitasking infrastructure:
  - Process table (MAX_PROCESSES = 16)
  - Process states: FREE, READY, RUNNING, BLOCKED, ZOMBIE
  - Round-robin scheduler
  - Context switching in assembly (kernel/context.S)
  - yield() and spawn() added to kapi
- Programs now load at 0x41000000+ with kernel picking addresses dynamically
- Tested: desktop→snake→tetris→desktop all load at different addresses
- **Achievement**: Dynamic loading and multitasking foundation complete!

### Session 10
- Added Apple menu with dropdown (About VibeOS..., Quit Desktop)
- Removed Q keyboard shortcut - quit only via Apple menu now
- Added font_data pointer to kapi for userspace text rendering
- Fixed window rendering - all drawing now goes to backbuffer:
  - Added bb_draw_char/bb_draw_string for backbuffer text
  - Windows properly occlude each other (no text bleed-through)
  - Title bars, content areas, and borders all render correctly
- Created LONGTERM.md with roadmap

### Session 11
- Added dock bar at bottom of screen with app icons
- Built Calculator app (first desktop app!):
  - Calculator icon in dock (32x32 pixel art)
  - Click dock icon to open calculator window
  - Working integer arithmetic (+, -, *, /)
  - 3D button styling with proper hit detection
  - Shows pending operation in display
  - Fixed PIE string literal issue (2D char* array → flat char[][] array)
- Improved menu bar layout and spacing
- Windows can't be dragged below the dock

### Session 12
- Built File Explorer app:
  - Folder icon in dock
  - Navigate directories (click to select, double-click to enter)
  - Path bar showing current location
  - ".." to go up a directory
  - Right-click context menu with: New File, New Folder, Rename, Delete
  - Inline rename with keyboard input (Enter to confirm, Escape to cancel)
- Added rm command to shell
- Added vfs_delete() and vfs_rename() to VFS layer
- Added fat32_rename() - modifies directory entry name in place
- Extended kapi with delete, rename, readdir, set_cwd, get_cwd
- Fixed macOS junk files (._, .DS_Store, .fseventsd) in Makefile:
  - Disk mounts with -nobrowse to prevent Finder indexing
  - Cleanup commands run after every mount/install

### Session 13
- Added snake and tetris game launchers to dock:
  - Snake icon (32x32 pixel art green snake)
  - Tetris icon (32x32 colorful blocks)
  - Click to launch games from desktop
- Fixed cooperative multitasking to actually work:
  - Added yield() calls to desktop, snake, and tetris main loops
  - Fixed process_yield() to work from kernel context (was returning early)
  - Made process_exec() create real process entries (was direct function call)
  - Added kernel_context to save/restore when switching between kernel and processes
- Games now use exec() instead of spawn():
  - Desktop blocks while game runs, resumes when game exits
  - Clean handoff - no screen fighting between processes
- **Achievement**: Can launch games from dock and return to desktop!

### Session 14
- Built userspace shell `/bin/vibesh`:
  - Boots directly into vibesh (kernel shell is now just a bootstrap)
  - Parses commands, handles builtins (cd, exit, help)
  - Executes external programs from /bin with argument passing
- Built userspace coreutils:
  - `/bin/echo` - with output redirection support (echo foo > file)
  - `/bin/ls` - uses proper readdir API
  - `/bin/cat` - supports multiple files
  - `/bin/pwd` - print working directory
  - `/bin/mkdir`, `/bin/touch`, `/bin/rm` - file operations
- Added `exec_args` to kapi for passing argc/argv to programs
- Added `console_rows`/`console_cols` to kapi
- Fixed process exit bug:
  - process_exit() was returning when no other processes existed
  - Now context switches directly back to kernel_context
- Attempted userspace vi but hit PIE/BSS issues:
  - Static variables in PIE binaries don't work reliably
  - Even heap-allocated state with function pointer calls hangs
  - Abandoned - will make GUI editor instead
- **Achievement**: Userspace shell and coreutils working!

### Session 15
- **MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH: Fixed PIE relocations!**
  - Userspace C code now works like normal C - pointers, string literals, everything
  - Problem: Static initializers with pointers (e.g., `const char *label = "hello"`) were broken
  - Root cause: With `-O2`, GCC generates PC-relative code but puts struct in BSS (zeroed), so pointers are NULL
  - Solution 1: Use `-O0` for userspace so GCC generates proper relocations
  - Solution 2: ELF loader now processes `.rela.dyn` section with `R_AARCH64_RELATIVE` entries
  - Added `Elf64_Dyn`, `Elf64_Rela` structs and `elf_process_relocations()` to kernel/elf.c
  - Formula: `*(load_base + offset) = load_base + addend`
- Rebuilt desktop from scratch (old one was a mess with everything embedded):
  - Clean window manager architecture
  - Desktop just manages windows, dock, menu bar, cursor
  - Apps are separate binaries that use window API via kapi
  - Fullscreen apps (snake, tetris) use exec() - desktop waits
  - Windowed apps (calc) use spawn() + window API
- Built Calculator app (`/bin/calc`):
  - First proper windowed app using the new window API
  - Creates window, gets buffer, draws buttons, receives events
  - Working integer arithmetic
- Window API in kapi:
  - `window_create()`, `window_destroy()`, `window_get_buffer()`
  - `window_poll_event()`, `window_invalidate()`, `window_set_title()`
  - Desktop registers these functions at startup
- **Achievement**: Can now write normal C code in userspace! This unlocks everything.

### Session 16
- **Visual refresh - True Mac System 7 aesthetic!**
  - Pure 1-bit black & white color scheme
  - Classic Mac diagonal checkerboard desktop pattern
  - Apple logo (16x16 bitmap) in menu bar
  - Beautiful 32x32 pixel art dock icons: Snake, Tetris, Calculator, Files, Terminal
  - System 7 window chrome: horizontal stripes on focused title bars, drop shadows, double-line borders
  - Close box with inner square when focused
  - Clock in menu bar (decorative)
- **Built Terminal Emulator (`/bin/term`)!**
  - 80x24 character window with monospace font
  - Spawns vibesh shell inside the window
  - Stdio hooks mechanism: `stdio_putc`, `stdio_puts`, `stdio_getc`, `stdio_has_key`
  - Shell and all coreutils use hooks when available, fall back to console otherwise
  - Keyboard input via window events → ring buffer → shell reads
  - Inverse block cursor
- **Updated all coreutils for terminal support:**
  - ls, cat, echo, pwd, mkdir, touch, rm all use `out_puts`/`out_putc` helpers
  - Check for stdio hooks, use them if set, otherwise use console I/O
  - Works in both kernel console AND terminal window
- **Achievement**: Shell running inside a GUI window! Can run commands, see output, everything works!

### Session 17
- **INTERRUPTS FINALLY WORKING!**
  - Root cause found: GIC security groups. Running in Non-Secure EL1 but trying to configure Group 0 registers was a no-op.
  - Solution: Boot at EL3 (Secure) using `-bios` instead of `-kernel`, stay in Secure world
  - Changed QEMU flags: `-M virt,secure=on -bios vibeos.bin`
  - Updated linker script: code at 0x0 (flash), data/BSS in RAM (0x40000000)
  - Updated boot.S: EL3→EL1 transition (skip EL2), copy .data from flash to RAM
  - GIC configured for Group 0 (Secure) interrupts
- **New files:**
  - `kernel/irq.c` / `kernel/irq.h` - GIC-400 driver, timer support
  - `kernel/vectors.S` - Exception vector table for AArch64
- **Keyboard now interrupt-driven:**
  - Registered IRQ handler for virtio keyboard (IRQ 78)
  - No more polling needed for keyboard input
- **Fixed FAT32 bug:**
  - `resolve_path()` was dereferencing NULL `rest` pointer from `strtok_r`
  - Added NULL check: `if (rest && *rest && ...)`
- **Timer ready but disabled:**
  - Timer IRQ handler exists, can enable preemptive multitasking later
  - Currently disabled to keep cooperative model stable
- **Achievement**: Full interrupt support! GIC mystery finally solved after Sessions 2-3 failures!

### Session 18
- **Enabled timer for uptime tracking:**
  - Timer fires at 100Hz (10ms intervals)
  - `timer_get_ticks()` returns tick count since boot
  - Keeping cooperative multitasking (no preemption)
- **Added uptime command (`/bin/uptime`):**
  - Shows hours/minutes/seconds since boot
  - Also shows raw tick count
  - Fixed crash: uptime wasn't in USER_PROGS list, old binary had wrong kapi struct
- **Added memory stats to kapi:**
  - `get_mem_used()` and `get_mem_free()`
  - Heap is ~16MB (between BSS end and program load area at 0x41000000)
- **Built System Monitor GUI app (`/bin/sysmon`):**
  - Classic Mac-style windowed app
  - Shows uptime (updates live)
  - Shows memory usage with progress bar (diagonal stripes pattern)
  - Shows used/free memory in MB
  - Auto-refreshes every ~500ms
- **Gotcha: USER_PROGS list**
  - New userspace programs MUST be added to USER_PROGS in Makefile
  - Old binaries on disk with outdated kapi struct will crash!
- **Achievement**: Timer working! System monitoring! The vibes are immaculate.

- **Built TextEdit (`/bin/textedit`):**
  - Simple GUI text editor - no modes, just type
  - Arrow keys, Home, End, Delete all work
  - Ctrl+S to save
  - Save As modal dialog when no filename set
  - Status bar shows filename, line:col, modified indicator
  - Scrolling for long files
  - Usage: `textedit` or `textedit /path/to/file`
- **Enhanced keyboard driver:**
  - Arrow keys now return special codes (0x100-0x106)
  - Ctrl modifier support (Ctrl+A = 1, Ctrl+S = 19, etc.)
  - Key buffer changed from `char` to `int` to support extended codes
  - Added Home, End, Delete key support
- **TextEdit enhancements:**
  - Line numbers in gray gutter on the left
  - Tab key inserts 4 spaces
  - Auto-close brackets and quotes: `()`, `[]`, `{}`, `""`, `''`
  - C syntax highlighting (detects .c and .h files):
    - Keywords in dark blue (if, else, for, while, return, etc.)
    - Comments in dark green (// and /* */)
    - String literals in dark red
    - Numbers in purple
  - Colors only appear in apps where it makes sense (desktop stays 1-bit B&W)
- **Achievement**: Real text editor with IDE-lite features!

### Session 19
- **Built File Explorer (`/bin/files`):**
  - Windowed GUI file browser
  - Navigate directories (click to select, double-click to enter)
  - Path bar showing current location
  - ".." to go up a directory
  - Right-click context menu with:
    - New File / New Folder (with inline rename UI)
    - Rename (inline text editing)
    - Delete (recursive - works on non-empty directories!)
    - Open with TextEdit
    - Open Terminal Here
  - Keyboard navigation (arrow keys, Enter, Backspace)
- **Added right-click support to desktop:**
  - Desktop now detects right mouse button clicks
  - Passes button info to windowed apps via event data3
- **Implemented recursive directory deletion:**
  - `fat32_delete_recursive()` - deletes files and directories recursively
  - Walks directory tree, deletes children first, then parent
  - Exposed via `vfs_delete_recursive()` and kapi
- **Improved create file/folder UX:**
  - "New File" / "New Folder" now shows inline rename field immediately
  - Type the name and press Enter to actually create
  - Press Escape to cancel
  - No more "untitled" / "newfolder" placeholder names
- **Achievement**: Full-featured file explorer!

### Session 21
- **Power management overhaul - CPU no longer cooks the host!**
  - Problem: Desktop was redrawing at infinite FPS, QEMU using 150% CPU
  - Root cause: Busy-wait loops everywhere, no sleeping
- **Mouse now interrupt-driven:**
  - Added `mouse_get_irq()` and `mouse_irq_handler()` (like keyboard)
  - Registered mouse IRQ in kernel.c
- **Added sleep functions to kapi:**
  - `wfi()` - ARM Wait For Interrupt instruction
  - `sleep_ms(ms)` - Sleep for at least N milliseconds using timer ticks
- **Kernel-level idle via WFI:**
  - When process yields and it's the only runnable process, scheduler calls WFI
  - CPU sleeps until next interrupt (timer at 100Hz, keyboard, or mouse)
  - This is the RIGHT approach - kernel handles idle, not apps
- **Removed busy-wait delays from games:**
  - Snake and Tetris had `delay()` functions doing NOPs
  - Replaced with `sleep_ms()` for proper game tick timing
- **Fixed recovery shell:**
  - Was busy-looping on `keyboard_getc()` with no sleep
  - Now WFIs when no input available
- **UI apps just yield():**
  - Desktop, calc, files, textedit, term, sysmon - all just call `yield()`
  - Kernel WFIs if nothing else to do, wakes on interrupt
  - Effective frame rate: 100fps (timer is 100Hz)
- **Result:**
  - CPU usage dropped from 150% to ~10% idle
  - UI runs at smooth 100fps
  - Mouse and keyboard remain responsive (interrupt-driven)
- **Achievement**: Proper power management! VibeOS is now a good citizen.

### Session 22
- **FAT32 Long Filename (LFN) Writing - COMPLETE!**
  - Can now create files/directories with any name length (up to 255 chars)
  - Implemented `needs_lfn()` - detects when LFN is required (lowercase, length, special chars)
  - Implemented `generate_basis_name()` - creates 8.3 basis from long name
  - Implemented `generate_short_name()` - creates unique 8.3 name with ~1, ~2, etc. suffix
  - Implemented `build_lfn_entry()` - constructs LFN directory entries with UTF-16LE encoding
  - Implemented `find_free_dir_entries()` - finds N consecutive free slots for LFN + short entry
  - Updated `create_dir_entry()` - writes LFN entries in reverse order followed by 8.3 entry
  - Updated `fat32_rename()` - deletes old entries (including LFN), creates new with LFN support
  - Updated `fat32_delete()`, `fat32_delete_dir()`, `fat32_delete_recursive()` - properly deletes LFN entries
  - Added `delete_dir_entry_with_lfn()` - finds and marks all associated LFN entries as deleted
- **Build fix**: fat32.c requires -O0 (added to Makefile)
  - GCC -O2 generates bad code for LFN byte manipulation
  - Caused translation faults when writing to valid heap memory
- **Achievement**: Full LFN support! `touch "my long filename.txt"` works!

### Session 23
- **Virtio Sound Driver - Audio playback working!**
  - Built complete virtio-sound driver (kernel/virtio_sound.c, kernel/virtio_sound.h)
  - Device ID 25, virtqueues: controlq (0), eventq (1), txq (2), rxq (3)
  - PCM stream lifecycle: set_params → prepare → start → submit data → stop
  - WAV file parsing with format/rate detection
  - Supports 44100Hz, 48000Hz sample rates; 16-bit stereo/mono
- **New files:**
  - `kernel/virtio_sound.c` - Full virtio sound driver (~600 lines)
  - `kernel/virtio_sound.h` - Public API: play_wav, stop, is_playing
  - `user/bin/play.c` - Userspace play command
- **Added to kapi:**
  - `sound_play_wav(data, size)` - Play WAV from memory
  - `sound_stop()` - Stop playback
  - `sound_is_playing()` - Check if playing
- **QEMU flags updated:**
  - Added `-device virtio-sound-device,audiodev=audio0 -audiodev coreaudio,id=audio0`
- **Critical boot fixes:**
  - Stack was at 0x40010000, inside BSS (0x40001000-0x400290d4) - getting overwritten!
  - Moved stack to 0x40100000 (1MB into RAM) in boot.S
  - `_data_load` at 0x1a9bb was NOT 8-byte aligned - caused hang during data copy
  - Added `. = ALIGN(8);` before `_data_load = .;` in linker.ld
- **Build change:**
  - Changed to `-O0` everywhere (both kernel and userspace) to avoid optimization issues
- **Fixed slow file loading:**
  - `play.c` was reading file twice: once to get size, once to load data
  - Added `file_size()` to kapi - returns vfs_node->size directly
  - Now files load instantly instead of 7+ seconds
- **Achievement**: VibeOS can play audio! `play /beep.wav` works!

### Session 24
- **Floating Point Support - COMPLETE!**
  - Enabled FPU in boot.S: `mov x0, #(3 << 20); msr cpacr_el1, x0`
  - Removed `-mgeneral-regs-only` from CFLAGS (was blocking all FP)
  - Added `-mstrict-align` to prevent unaligned SIMD access faults
  - GCC now uses SIMD for memcpy/struct ops, which is fine with strict-align
- **Context switch updated for FP state:**
  - Extended cpu_context_t: added fpcr, fpsr, _pad, fp_regs[64]
  - _pad ensures fp_regs is at offset 0x80 (16-byte aligned for stp/ldp q regs)
  - context.S now saves/restores all 32 Q registers (q0-q31) plus fpcr/fpsr
- **Calculator now uses floating point:**
  - Changed display_value/pending_value from int to double
  - Added decimal point button (replaced C button)
  - Added float_to_str() for display (no printf %f available)
  - Clear via 'c'/'C' keyboard key
  - Can now do: 10 / 3 = 3.333333, 3.14159 * 2, etc.
- **MAJOR BUG FIX: Kernel stack vs heap collision**
  - Symptom: Process exit crashed with `0x00ffffff` in return address
  - Root cause: Kernel stack at 0x40100000 was INSIDE heap range (0x4003c0d4 - 0x41000000)
  - Large heap allocations (backbuffer) overwrote stack with framebuffer data
  - Debug showed local variable `old_pid` corrupted from -1 to 0x00ffffff (COLOR_WHITE)
  - Fix: Moved stack to 0x4F000000, well above heap and program load area
- **Memory layout clarified:**
  ```
  0x40000000 - 0x40200000: DTB (Device Tree Blob, placed by QEMU)
  0x40200000 - 0x40237000: Kernel .data/.bss
  0x40247000 - 0x4E000000: Heap (dynamic, up to stack - 1MB)
  0x4E000000+:             Program load area (after heap)
  0x4F000000:              Kernel stack (grows down, hardcoded)
  RAM end:                 Detected from DTB (256MB-4GB+)
  ```
- **Memory collision issue (MOSTLY FIXED in Session 26)**
  - Was: hardcoded magic numbers everywhere that collided as kernel grew
  - Now: heap and program areas are dynamic based on DTB-detected RAM
  - Stack is still hardcoded at 0x4F000000 (works for 256MB+ systems)
  - Heap is bounded by stack address, so can't overflow into stack anymore
- **Achievement**: Floating point works! Calculator does decimals! Processes exit cleanly!

- **Enabled -O3 optimization!**
  - Changed CFLAGS and USER_CFLAGS from -O0 to -O3
  - Everything works except kernel's `fat32_delete_recursive()` which breaks with -O3
  - Solution: Moved recursive delete logic to userspace (rm.c and files.c)
  - Kernel only needs to delete single files and empty directories
  - Userspace iterates with `readdir()` and deletes children before parent
- **Userspace recursive delete:**
  - `rm -r` now implements recursion in userspace
  - Files app delete action uses same userspace implementation
  - Works correctly with -O3 optimization
- **Achievement**: Full -O3 optimization across kernel and userspace!

### Session 25
- **Desktop modularization - code cleanup!**
  - Extracted icon bitmaps to `user/lib/icons.h` (~500 lines of bitmap data)
  - Created VibeOS logo (stylized "V") to replace Apple logo
  - Created shared graphics library `user/lib/gfx.h` (header-only, ~130 lines)
  - Updated all GUI apps to use gfx.h instead of duplicated drawing code:
    - desktop.c, calc.c, sysmon.c, files.c, textedit.c
  - Removed ~250 lines of duplicated buf_*/bb_* drawing functions across apps
  - desktop.c reduced from ~1500 to ~1200 lines
- **New files:**
  - `user/lib/icons.h` - All 32x32 dock icons + 16x16 VibeOS logo
  - `user/lib/gfx.h` - gfx_ctx_t context, put_pixel, fill_rect, draw_char, draw_string, draw_rect, patterns
- **Architecture note:**
  - gfx.h is header-only with static inline functions - no Makefile changes needed
  - Apps use macros to alias old function names (buf_*, bb_*) to new gfx_* calls
  - Zero runtime overhead, compiler inlines everything
- **Achievement**: Cleaner codebase! Shared graphics primitives!

### Session 26
- **Device Tree Blob (DTB) parsing - RAM detection at runtime!**
  - Built DTB parser (`kernel/dtb.c`, `kernel/dtb.h`)
  - Parses QEMU's device tree to find memory node with base/size
  - Tested with 256MB, 1GB, 4GB - all detected correctly
- **Dynamic memory layout - no more hardcoded heap size!**
  - Linker script now starts RAM at 0x40200000 (preserves DTB at 0x40000000)
  - Heap size computed at runtime: from BSS end to (stack - 1MB buffer)
  - Program load area follows heap_end dynamically
  - Framebuffer now allocated via malloc instead of hardcoded address
- **Memory layout now:**
  - DTB preserved at 0x40000000 (up to 2MB reserved)
  - Kernel .data/.bss at 0x40200000+
  - Heap from BSS end to 0x4E000000 (~238MB on 256MB system)
  - Programs load after heap
  - Stack still hardcoded at 0x4F000000 (works for 256MB+ systems)
- **Key insight:** One shared address space (Win3.1 model)
  - Heap is shared by kernel + all apps
  - App static variables (`int x = 3`) live in ELF's .data section, loaded into program area
  - Only explicit `malloc()` uses the heap
- **Gotcha: DTB unaligned access**
  - Direct pointer casts to read 32/64-bit values cause alignment faults
  - Must read bytes individually and assemble (see `read_be32`/`read_be64`)
- **Achievement**: RAM detected dynamically! No more arbitrary 256MB cap!

### Session 27
- **MP3 Playback - minimp3 ported!**
  - Integrated minimp3 single-header decoder into userspace
  - Created stub headers `user/lib/stdlib.h` and `user/lib/string.h` for freestanding build
  - Added `memcmp`, `memmove` to string.h stub
  - `#define MINIMP3_NO_SIMD` to avoid NEON complexity (can enable later for perf)
- **Refactored sound API:**
  - Moved WAV parsing from kernel to userspace (kernel shouldn't parse file formats)
  - Added `sound_play_pcm(data, samples, channels, rate)` to kapi - flexible raw PCM playback
  - Kernel's `hz_to_rate_index()` converts Hz to virtio rate constants
- **Mono to stereo conversion:**
  - virtio-sound doesn't support mono playback
  - play.c converts mono MP3s to stereo by duplicating samples
- **Async (non-blocking) playback!**
  - Added `sound_play_pcm_async()` - starts playback and returns immediately
  - Added `virtio_sound_pump()` - called from timer interrupt (100Hz) to feed audio chunks

  - MP3 loading improvements: Single-pass decode with loading state indicators

### Session 36
- **Fixed critical memory corruption bug in TTF rendering:**
  - Browser was consuming ALL available RAM (tested 512MB and 8GB - both exhausted!)
  - sysmon showed only 73 allocations, ~11MB heap "used", but 0MB "free" - contradiction
  - Root cause identified with help from Gemini: **buffer overflow in `apply_italic()`**
  - Bug: `apply_italic` was calculating `extra_w` again on top of already-expanded buffer
    - Called with `alloc_w` (already includes italic space)
    - Internally calculated `out_w = w + extra_w` (doubling the expansion)
    - `memcpy(bitmap, temp_bitmap, out_w * h)` wrote past buffer end
  - This corrupted heap metadata, breaking the free list traversal
  - Fixed by passing original glyph width separately from stride
- **Enhanced sysmon with memory debugging:**
  - Added `get_heap_start()`, `get_heap_end()`, `get_stack_ptr()`, `get_alloc_count()` to kapi
  - sysmon now shows: heap bounds, heap size, stack pointer, allocation count
  - Helped diagnose the memory corruption (heap looked full because free list was broken)
- **Cache eviction fix:**
  - TTF glyph cache eviction now frees bitmap allocations before resetting
  - Previously leaked all 128 bitmaps on each cache wrap
- **Expanded font size caches:**
  - Added sizes 14, 18, 20, 28 to match browser heading sizes
  - Prevents cache misses for common sizes
- **Known issue:** Italic rendering is still broken (garbled output)
  - The buffer overflow is fixed, but the shear logic needs more work
  - Bold works fine, italic produces garbage
- **Files changed:**
  - `kernel/ttf.c` - Fixed apply_italic buffer overflow, cache eviction
  - `kernel/memory.c` - Added debug functions
  - `kernel/memory.h` - Declared debug functions
  - `kernel/kapi.c`, `kernel/kapi.h` - Added memory debug to kapi
  - `user/lib/vibe.h` - Added memory debug functions
  - `user/bin/sysmon.c` - Added Memory Debug section

    - DOM nodes (element and text types)
    - Tree structure (parent, children, siblings)
    - Attribute storage (id, class, style, href)
    - User-agent default styles for HTML elements
    - Style inheritance (color, font-size, etc. inherit from parent)
    - Computed style calculation (cascade: UA → stylesheet → inline)
    - Selector matching against DOM nodes
- **Updated files:**
  - `user/bin/browser/html.h` - Rewrote HTML parser to build DOM tree:
    - Creates proper tree structure instead of flat list
    - Extracts `<style>` blocks and parses them
    - Stores id, class, style, href attributes on nodes
    - Computes styles after parsing
    - `dom_to_blocks()` converts DOM to flat render list (legacy compatibility)
    - Fixed: href attribute now stored properly (was placeholder)
    - Fixed: Duplicate newline prevention (tracks last_was_newline)
  - `user/bin/browser/main.c` - Updated renderer:
    - Uses CSS colors from text blocks
    - Uses CSS font-size for TTF rendering
    - Uses CSS margin-left for indentation
    - Skips blocks with `display:none` (is_hidden flag)
    - Fixed TTF word wrapping (was going off-screen):
      - Estimates char width based on font size (not fixed 8px)
      - Renders word-by-word with wrap check
      - Wraps to next line if word would exceed right edge
  - `user/lib/crt0.S` - Added memcpy, memmove, memset implementations:
    - GCC generates calls to these for struct copies with -O3
    - Assembly implementations for AArch64
- **Bug fixes:**
  - CSS parser infinite loop on Wikipedia - selectors starting with `:` caused hang
  - Added pseudo-selector skipping (`:hover`, `:not()`, `::before`, etc.)
  - Added safety: skip unknown characters, handle malformed rules gracefully
  - Links were untappable - href wasn't being stored/passed through
- **Wikipedia now renders!** (was hanging before)
- **Text wraps properly** (was going off-screen)
- **Reduced whitespace** (was adding double newlines everywhere)
- **Links clickable again** (href properly stored in DOM and passed to renderer)
- **Achievement**: CSS engine complete! Wikipedia is usable!

### Session 38

  - When opened with file argument:
    - Enters compact "Now Playing" mode (350x200 window)
    - Shows filename centered with playback controls
    - Just Play/Pause button (no prev/next)
    - Auto-plays immediately on launch
  - When opened without arguments: Album browser mode (existing behavior)
  - New `play_file()` function handles both MP3 and WAV decoding
  - WAV support: Parses RIFF header, extracts PCM, handles mono→stereo conversion
  - `ends_with()` helper for case-insensitive extension checking
  - Prep work for file manager associations (double-click .mp3/.wav opens Music player)
- **Achievement**: Music player ready for file associations!

- **File Manager - Default App Associations!**
  - Double-click files to open them with the appropriate app
  - Smart file type detection:
    - Image extensions (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.bmp`, `.gif`) → `/bin/viewer`
    - Audio extensions (`.mp3`, `.wav`) → `/bin/music`
    - Everything else: content-based text detection
  - `is_text_file()` - reads first 512 bytes, checks for null bytes and control chars
    - Null byte = binary file
    - >10% non-printable chars = binary file
    - Otherwise = text file → `/bin/textedit`
  - No giant extension list needed - just 9 media extensions, rest is auto-detected
  - Binary files silently ignored (no app association)
- **Added `spawn_args()` to kernel API:**
  - Like `spawn()` but with argc/argv support
  - Non-blocking: parent continues immediately
  - Files app now opens files concurrently (can open multiple at once)
  - `kernel/kapi.c`, `kernel/kapi.h`, `user/lib/vibe.h` updated
- **Achievement**: File associations complete! Double-click any file to open it!
